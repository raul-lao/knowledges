BUILDING PROJECTS

1. run "make" to build all projects of C language.

2. if you want to add new project, make a new directory and add directory name into 'arch.mk' file

1) cd <your-local-folder>/knowledges/c
2) mkdir <your-project-name>
3) add <your-project-name> into a arch.mk
SUBDIR = <other-project-name> <your-project-name> see arch.mk .
4) Each new project must have depends.mk loc_config.mk and Makefile to build your projects.
5) loc_config.mk definites 3 variables 'BIN', 'SHARE' and 'ARCHIVE' to specify the name of executable, dynamic lib and static lib
i.e.
BIN = demo
SHARE = libdemo.so
ARCHIVE = libdemo.a

6) depends.mk defintes 'DEPEND_PROS' to specify the dependency of your project
i.e.
DEPEND_PROS = aaa, 'aaa' also shall exist here.

Now DEPEND_PROS can not handle dependency and it only add target directory into -I, -L and -Wl,-rpath.

3. To build specific project, use "make Target="target-1 target-2"

4. To clean all temporary file generated by compiling, run "make clean"

5. If you only modified head file, Makefile will also detect that so you do not need to clean first.
